# odin-etchaSketch
The Odin Project Etch-a-Sketch code challange.
In this project I have created an interactive web page similiar to an etch a sketch where the user can use there mouse to etch different drawings into a container. The container has grid squares that generate a ranom color when a mouse over is detected and gets darker with each mouseover up to 10 mouseovers at which the grid square is at full opacity. 

Additionally the user can click the button to enter a number which will directly determine the number of grid squares for each side of the container up to 100 squares per side. Upon entering a number the old grid is emptied and the new grid is formed with out changing the total size of the container.

This demonstrates my knowledge of functions, event listeners, for loops as well as if else conditionals when working with javascript. Additionally I have demonstrated my knowledge of basic html and css.
